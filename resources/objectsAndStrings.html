Objects in JavaScript differs a bit from objects in Java. That means, that objects in JavaScript
also can act as variables which they can't in Java. Object-variables in JavaScript can contain 
many values. These values in an object can then be called or changed. Spaces and line breaks in 
in declaration of an object is not important. So for greater readability you can add as many line breaks
as wished. 

A property in a js-object can be accessed in two different ways: 
<code>objectName.propertyName</code> 
or
<code>objectName["propertyName"]</code>

                    <h5>Example on JavaScript objects</h5>
                    <pre>
                        In this example it will be demonstrated how an object gets initialized and how it can be changed and overwrited 
                        to contain different values of data.
                        <code>
var thisSong = {"description": "The best song in the world.", "artist": "Michael Jackson", "song": "Billie Jean"};

//Removes the property "description" from the object
delete thisSong.description;

console.log("Only artist:", thisSong.artist);
console.log("All information:", thisSong)

//Overwriting the object with a property called "about".
thisSong = {"about": "Michael Jackson doesn't live any longer"};
console.log("Overwrited object:", thisSong); 

//Output
Only artist: Michael Jackson
All information: { artist: 'Michael Jackson', song: 'Billie Jean' }
Overwrited object { about: "Michael Jackson doesn't live any longer" }
                            </code>
                    </pre>

                <h4>Strings</h4>
                <button id = "stringsButton"></button>

Strings in JavaScript get initialized with the <code><b>var</b></code> declaration 
and can either be defined as predefined values or as input from an argument in a method.
A string in JavaScript stores a series of characters. A string can be a text of either 
double or single quotes.

                </p>
                   <h5>Example - getting a character from an index in a string</h5>
                    <pre id = "exampleStringsInfo">
A specific character in a string can be accessed with either the method charAt() or 
by indexing into the string. Furthermore you could say that a given string is a 
sort of an array of chars.
                            <code>
var letters = "abc"
// Getting the character "c"
console.log("Letters: " + letters.charAt(2));
console.log("Array index: " + letters[2]);

//Output
Letters: c
Array index: c
                            </code>
