Objects in JavaScript differs a bit from objects in Java. That means, that objects in JavaScript
also can act as variables which they can't in Java. Object-variables in JavaScript can contain 
many values. These values in an object can then be called or changed. Spaces and line breaks in 
in declaration of an object is not important. So for greater readability you can add as many line breaks
as wished. 

A property in a js-object can be accessed in two different ways: 
<code>objectName.propertyName</code> 
or
<code>objectName["propertyName"]</code>
                    </pre>
                </p>
                <dd>
                    <h5>Example on JavaScript objects</h5>
                    <p>
                        <pre>
In this example it will be demonstrated how an object gets initialized and how it can be changed and overwrited 
to contain different values of data.
                            <code>
var thisSong = {"description": "The best song in the world.", "artist": "Michael Jackson", "song": "Billie Jean"};

//Removes the property "description" from the object
delete thisSong.description;

console.log("Only artist:", thisSong.artist);
console.log("All information:", thisSong)

//Overwriting the object with a property called "about".
thisSong = {"about": "Michael Jackson doesn't live any longer"};
console.log("Overwrited object:", thisSong); 

//Output
Only artist: Michael Jackson
All information: { artist: 'Michael Jackson', song: 'Billie Jean' }
Overwrited object { about: "Michael Jackson doesn't live any longer" }
                            </code>
                        </pre>
                    </p>
