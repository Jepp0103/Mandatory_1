Node is an open-source JavaScript runtime environment which can exequte JavaScript code 
outside a browser. Node.js can let JavaScript become executed in a command line before 
the actual content is shown in a browser. Node.js is a paradigm to include JavaScript in 
many frameworks. The js-notation in "Node.js" doesn't refer to a js-file but is just the 
name of the service to run JavaScript.

At first the user navigates to a specific folder where the given JS-file is located.
That can be done by using the <code><b><u>cd</u></b></code> command and then use the tab button 
on the keyboard to browse into the right folder. After accessing the right source folder,
the given js-program can be run with the following command:

Express.js is a sub framework for Node.js. It is a server framework for Node.js which works as a 
back-end component for MEAN-stack (overall list of components written in JavaScript
including MongoDB-database, AngularJS, Node.js, Express.js). Express helps optimizing performance
and does also support SSL and TLS security systems. 
Express provides the service to send html pages to a browser so they can get displayed.

                                    <pre>
At first a JSON-file called <i>package.json</i> has to be created with the following dependencies
and their version numbers:
                                    </pre>
                                    <pre>
<code>
{ 
    "dependencies": { 
        "express": "4.17.1", 
        "request": "^2.88.2" 
    } 
} 
</code>
                                    </pre>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <pre>
Afterwards you have to install all node modules which are given libraries for the node running tool.
In order to install the modules, simply type <code><b><u>npm install</u></b></code> in the terminal after navigating 
to the folder where the <i>package.json</i> file is located. From there the node tool will generate a package-lock.json file
which includes dependencies for the node modules.
                                    </pre>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <pre>
At last you have to import the express functionality in your wished JavaScript-file in order to use 
the modules that has been installed. That is done by the following code:
<code>
//The way to import packages from node modules 
var express = require("express");
var app = express();
const request = require("request");
</code>
                                    </pre>
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <b> More on how express can be used to display HTML-pages etc. are described on the page <i>jQuery and routing</i>.</b>
                        </p>
                    </dd>
                    <br>
                <dt>
                    <h4>nodemon</h4>
                    <p>
                        <pre>
nodemon is a tool that can help to develop node.js based application to restart automatically
each time some edition to a file has been made. The tool detects a change to file frequently.
nodemon does not require any editions to code or development. It's an extension for running 
js-applications.
                        </pre>
                    </p>
                    <dd>
                        <h5>Setting up nodemon tool</h5>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <pre>
At first install nodemon tool by using npm as a development dependency: 
<code><b><u>npm install -g nodemon</u></b></code>
                                </pre>      
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <pre>
After the installment the nodemon tool can be used to run a js-program:
<code><b><u>nodemon app.js</u></b></code>
                                </pre>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </dd>
                </dt>
                <dt>
                    <h4>Budo</h4>
                    <p>
                        <pre>
Budo is a server focused reloading integration for js-development. The tool live reloads a working page
every time a change to the document occur. That makes it a lot easier to test visualization of a given
HTML-page for instance.
                        </pre>
                    </p>
                        <dd>
                            <h5>Setting up the Bundo tool</h5>
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    <pre>
At first install bundo by running the command <code><b><u>npm install budo -g</u></b></code>
                                    </pre>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <pre>
Afterwards bundo can be used to live reload a certain file by running the following command after
entering the correct folder ind the terminal:
                                    </pre>
<code>
PS C:\Users\Jeppe N. Dyekjær\Documents\3._Datamatiker\Git_projekter_4_semester\Node_JS\NODE_JS_2020\3._jQuery\1._Intro_To_jQuery> npx budo index.js --live --open
</code>
<p> 
    When the command succeeds with a status 200 get response in the terminal, the file will now automatically update in the browser window after each edition to the file.
</p>
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                        </dd>
