    On this page you will get to learn some basic principles of the framework 
    called Node JS. That includes some concrete examples on how to write JavaScript 
    and the sub-language to it called jQuery. 
    You will also get to know the running tool called Node which is a tool for running
    JavaScript. Like other languages a developer needs an environment or set-up installed
    in order to run a specific programming language. Hence Node is needed for running 
    JavaScript in a smart way and independant of other frameworks, language integrations etc. Ex
    if you want to run only one JavaScript file in the terminal.
