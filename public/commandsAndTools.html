    Node is an open-source JavaScript runtime environment which can exequte JavaScript code 
    outside a browser. Node.js can let JavaScript become executed in a command line before 
    the actual content is shown in a browser. Node.js is a paradigm to include JavaScript in 
    many frameworks. The js-notation in "Node.js" doesn't refer to a js-file but is just the 
    name of the service to run JavaScript.

    source folder, the given js-program can be run with the following command:

    <h4>Routing and callback function</h4>
    <button id = "routingButton"></button>
    <br>
    <pre id = "routingInfo">
    Routing is about how endpoints of applications (URIs) respond to client requests.
    Routing in Express is defined by using certain methods in the Express environment which
    corresponds to HTTP-methods ex. <code><b>app.get()</b></code> to handle GET requests, 
    <code><b>app.post()</b></code> to handle POST requests or <code><b>app.all()</b></code>
    to handle all types of HTTP-methods at once.

    All these routing methods specify a callback function (handler functions), which is 
    called when an application receives a request to a specified endpoint. We make the application
    listen for certain routes and methods in order to detect a match.

    Routing methods can have multiple callback functions as arguments. When having to use
    the next defined callback function after the first, you have to use the method 
    <code><b>next()</b></code> to enter that one.

    The over all definition and method call declaration of a route looks like this
    <code><b>app.METHOD(PATH, HANDLER);</b></code>

    <code><b>app</b></code>: an instance of express.
    <code><b>METHOD</b></code>: an HTTP request method, in lowercase.
    <code><b>PATH</b></code>: a path to a given server.
    <code><b>HANDLER</b></code>: a function executed when the route matches the function.

    Express.js is a sub framework for Node.js. It is a server framework for Node.js which works as a 
    back-end component for MEAN-stack (overall list of components written in JavaScript
    including MongoDB-database, AngularJS, Node.js, Express.js). Express helps optimizing performance
    and does also support SSL and TLS security systems. 
    Express provides the service to send html pages to a browser so they can get displayed.

                        At first a JSON-file called <i>package.json</i> has to be created with the following dependencies
                        and their version numbers:
                                                    
                            <code>
                        { 
                            "dependencies": { 
                                "express": "4.17.1" 
                            } 
                        } 
                            </code>

                Afterwards you have to install all node modules which are given libraries for the node running tool.
                In order to install the modules, simply type <code><b><u>npm install</u></b></code> in the terminal after navigating 
                to the folder where the <i>package.json</i> file is located. From there the node tool will generate 
                a package-lock.json file which includes dependencies for the node modules.
                                                
                At last you have to import the express functionality in your wished JavaScript-file in order to use 
                the modules that has been installed. That is done by the following code:
                        <code>
        //The way to import packages from node modules 
        var express = require("express");
        var app = express();
        const request = require("request");
                        </code>
                        </pre>

At first install nodemon tool by using npm as a development dependency: 
    <code><b><u>npm install -g nodemon</u></b></code>
                                    </pre>

After the installment the nodemon tool can be used to run a js-program:
    <code><b><u>nodemon app.js</u></b></code>
                                    </pre>

                        <h4>Budo</h4>

                                        <pre>
At first install bundo by running the command <code><b><u>npm install budo -g</u></b></code>
                                        </pre>
                                    </li>

                                        <pre>
Afterwards bundo can be used to live reload a certain file by running the following command after
entering the correct folder ind the terminal:
                                        </pre>
    <code>
PS C:\Users\Jeppe N. Dyekjær\Documents\3._Datamatiker\Git_projekter_4_semester\Node_JS\NODE_JS_2020\3._jQuery\1._Intro_To_jQuery> npx budo index.js --live --open
    </code>
                                        <pre>

When the command succeeds with a status 200 get response in the terminal, the file will 
now automatically update in the browser window after each edition to the file.
                                        </pre>
