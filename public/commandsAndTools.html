    Node is an open-source JavaScript runtime environment which can exequte JavaScript code 
    outside a browser. Node.js can let JavaScript become executed in a command line before 
    the actual content is shown in a browser. Node.js is a paradigm to include JavaScript in 
    many frameworks. The js-notation in "Node.js" doesn't refer to a js-file but is just the 
    name of the service to run JavaScript.

    At first the user navigates to a specific folder where the given JS-file is located. 
    That can be done by using the <code><b><u>cd</u></b></code> command and then use the 
    tab button on the keyboard to browse into the right folder. After accessing the right 
    source folder, the given js-program can be run with the following command:
                                </pre>

npm which stands for Node Package Manager is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language. 
npm is the default runtime environment for Node.js. The environment contains a command line client, 
which is called npm and an online database of public and paid private packages (npm registry). The 
registry is accessed from a client ex. a PC or local webpage. From there the client can browse through 
the different available packages from the npm website.
                        </pre>
                    </dt>
                    <dt id = "npmRunInfo">
                        <h5>npm run start</h5>
                        <pre>
npm run start can be used to run predefined scripts in the terminal. The scripts are defined in the 
<code>package.json</code>-file. So instead of typing many different commands after each other in the 
terminal to run a certain application, all those commands can be predefined as script in the mentioned
json-file by writing the following script:
                                <code>
{
    "scripts": {
        "start": "node app.js",
        "start-dev": "nodemon app.js"
    }
}
                                </code>
Now all these commands and even more commands if added can be executed at the same time by only running
the command <code><b>npm run start</b></code>. It makes it a lot easier to execute many operations at the same time.
Furthermore if the code for the given file has been implemented with the right code to define an own portnumber
when running an application, the following script can be extended with the attribute <code><b>cross-env PORT=?</b></code>:
                                <code>
    {
        "scripts": {
            "start": "cross-env PORT=80 node app.js",
            "start-dev": "cross-env nodemon app.js set PORT=3000"
        },
        "devDependencies": {
            "cross-env": "^7.0.2"
        }
    }
                                </code>
                        </pre>

                        <pre>
<code>npm init < initializer ></code> is an npm-command which can be used to set up a new or existing 
npm package. The initialized and defined package will look like the following picture where certain 
descriptive attributes will be added to the <code>package.json</code>-file.
<code>"devDependencies"</code> are packages that are used for local development and testing, where as 
<code>"dependencies"</code> are required for an application to actually run: 
                        </pre>

                                <pre id = "expressInfo">
    Express.js is a sub framework for Node.js. It is a server framework for Node.js which works as a 
    back-end component for MEAN-stack (overall list of components written in JavaScript
    including MongoDB-database, AngularJS, Node.js, Express.js). Express helps optimizing performance
    and does also support SSL and TLS security systems. 
    Express provides the service to send HTML pages to a browser so they can get displayed.

                                <pre>
                        At first a JSON-file called <i>package.json</i> has to be created with the following dependency
                        and the version number:
                                                    
                            <code>
                        { 
                            "dependencies": { 
                                "express": "4.17.1" 
                            } 
                        } 
                            </code>

                Afterwards you have to install all node modules which are given libraries for the node running tool.
                In order to install the modules, simply type <code><b><u>npm install</u></b></code> or 
                <code><b><u>npm install express</u></b></code> (for only using express modules) in the terminal after
                navigating to the folder where the <i>package.json</i> file is located. From there the node tool will 
                generate a package-lock.json file which includes dependencies for the node modules.
                                                
                At last you have to import the express functionality in your wished JavaScript-file in order to use 
                the modules that has been installed. That is done by the following code:
                        <code>
        //The way to import packages from node modules 
        const express = require("express");
        const app = express();
        const request = require("request");
                        </code>
                        </pre>
                        </dt>
                        <dt>

                            <button id = "nodemonButton"></button>
                            <br>
                                <pre id = "nodemonInfo">
        nodemon is a tool that can help to develop node.js based applications to restart automatically
        each time some edition to a file has been made. The tool detects a change to file frequently.

        js-applications.

At first install nodemon tool by using npm as a development dependency: 
    <code><b><u>npm install -g nodemon</u></b></code>
                                    </pre>

                                        <pre>
Afterwards bundo can be used to live reload a certain file by running the following command after
entering the correct folder ind the terminal:
                                        </pre>

    </code>
                                        <pre>

When the command succeeds with a status 200 GET response in the terminal, the file will 
now automatically update in the browser window after each edition to the file.
