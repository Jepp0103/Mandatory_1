        jQuery is a fast phased, small library with additional features to JavaScript. 
        The main advantages of using jQuery is, that HTML document traversal and manipulation, 
        event handling and animations are on ex. web pages much simpler to implement. 
        jQuery is accessed via basic JavaScript.

        <h4>Accessing and manipulating HTML with jQuery</h4>
        <button id = "introButton"></button>

        <pre id = "jQueryBasicInfo">
            The dollar sign, <code><b>$</b></code>, works as an accessor for a given selector tag, id or class declaration etc. 
            in HTML. The jQuery language can then manipulate the HTML-content. 
            <code>
                $("selector").action();
                //$ = accessor
            </code>

            Below we can see nearly all possible ways of defining selectors depending on which kind of tag
            we want the jQuery to refer to in a certain HTML-document. Then the jQuery language are able to
            manipulate these different selectors with different supported methods (next picture).

<b>removeClass();</b> /*The removeClass() method removes one or more class names 
                        from the selected elements.*/

<b>toggleClass();</b> /*The toggleClass() method toggles between adding/removing 
                        classes from the selected elements, meaning that if the 
                        specified class exists for the element, it is removed, and 
                        if it does not exist, it is added.*/

        In this section different examples on the use of jQuery will be demonstrated:

            The lion (Panthera leo) is a species in the family Felidae; it is a muscular, 
            deep-chested cat with a short, rounded head, a reduced neck and round ears, and 
            a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions 
            have a prominent mane, which is the most recognisable feature of the species. With 
            a typical head-to-body length of 184–208 cm (72–82 in) they are larger than females
            at 160–184 cm (63–72 in). It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion
            pride consists of a few adult males, related females and cubs. Groups of female lions 
            usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone 
            predator, although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur, and have been known to hunt 
            humans, although the species typically does not.
