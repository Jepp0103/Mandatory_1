        <h4>Routing and callback function</h4>
        <button id = "routingButton"></button>

        <pre id = "routingInfo">
            Routing is about how endpoints of applications (URIs) respond to client requests.
            Routing in Express is defined by using certain methods in the Express environment
            which corresponds to HTTP-methods ex. <code><b>app.get()</b></code> to handle GET 
            requests, <code><b>app.post()</b></code> to handle POST requests or <code><b>app.all()</b></code>
            to handle all types of HTTP-methods at once.
        
            All these routing methods specify a callback function (handler function), which is 
            called when an application receives a request to a specified endpoint. We make the 
            application listen for certain routes and methods in order to detect a match.
        
            Routing methods can have multiple callback functions as arguments. When having to use
            the next defined callback function after the first, you have to use the method 
            <code><b>next()</b></code> to enter that one.
        
            The over all definition and method call declaration of a route looks like this
            <code><b>app.METHOD(PATH, HANDLER);</b></code>
        
            <code><b>app</b></code>: an instance of express.
            <code><b>METHOD</b></code>: an HTTP request method, in lowercase.
            <code><b>PATH</b></code>: a path to a given server.
            <code><b>HANDLER</b></code>: a function executed when the route matches the function.
        </pre>

        <h4>HTTP Requests</h4>
        <pre id = "requestsInfo">
        An HTTP client sends a request to a given server as a request message which includes the 
        following elements:
            1. A request line
            2. Zero or more header fields.
            3. An empty line which indicates the end of a header field.
            4. Optionally a message body.

        <b>Supported methods for HTTP requests:</b>
            <b>GET:</b> the GET method is used to receive information from a server by using a 
                certain URI. GET methods only receives data and does not affect any data.
            <b>POST:</b> the POST method is used to send data to a server which can be text based 
                or file based.
            <b>PUT:</b> the PUT method is used to update or edit existing data on the server ex. 
                texts or files.
            <b>DELETE:</b> removes all representations of text or file defined in the URL.
        
        <b>Example on different request in Express:</b>
            In the following example we will take a look on how the POST-, PUT- and DELETE-methods 
            can be used. In the beginning we define an array with objects describing a car including
            id and brand:
            <code>
                                    var cars = [
                                        { 
                                            "id": 1, 
                                            "brand": "Mercedes"
                                        },           
                                        {
                                            "id": 2,
                                            "brand": "Peugeot"
                                        },
                                        {
                                            "id": 3,
                                            "brand": "Lamborgini"
                                        }
                                    ]
            </code>
            Afterwards an example on how to use the post request is given below. The application tries to add 
            certain data to the URL /cars by only having to type in a new brand from a user. The id will be 
            auto incremented (generated) when adding a new car, so a user doesn't need to write the id:
            At first the <code>newCar</code>-object is instantiated by the input of the request body 
            - <code>req.body</code>. When defining the id variable in the car object it takes the current/maximum
            car id in the cars list and increments the number by 1 to define the new id. When the id has been 
            added to the object, then the car object is added to the list with the <code>push()</code>-method. 
            At the end the result returns a response body:
            <code>
            app.post("/cars", (req, res) => {
                console.log(req.body);
            
                let newCar = req.body;
                newCar.id = ++currentId;
                console.log(newCar);
                cars.push(newCar);
            
                return res.send({response: {}});
            });
            </code>

            In the next example we will look at the PUT-method in order to update details about an already existing car object. 
            At first an index is initialized by using the <code>findexIndex()</code>-method where number of the id from the 
            request parameter in the method body is used as index number. Then we know what id is 
            <code>
            app.put("cars/:id", (req, res) => {
                const foundIndex = cars.findIndex(car => car.id === Number(req.params.id));
                delete req.body.id;
                console.log("0000", foundIndex);
                const updatedCar = { ...cars[foundIndex], ...req.body };
                cars[foundIndex] = updatedCar;
            
                return res.send({ response: cars});
            });
            </code>                    
            
            <code>
            app.delete("/cars/:id", (req, res) => {
                //looping through each car in the list and getting the id from the body
                cars = cars.filter(car => car.id !== Number(req.params.id)) 
                //Number passes a string to an int
                return res.send({ response: cars });
            });



            </code>
